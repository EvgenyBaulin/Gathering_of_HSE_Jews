# Search for Potential Jews among Members of VK Groups

## Overview

This project is dedicated to identifying potential members for the Jewish club at the Higher School
of Economics (HSE). Using data collected from VK (Vkontakte) groups, we analyzed various parameters
of participants in groups dedicated to HSE. By examining user profiles and interactions within these
groups, we aimed to identify individuals who might be interested in joining the Jewish club at HSE.

## Methodology

The project involved:

- Collecting data from VK groups via available APIs and data scraping techniques.
- Analyzing parameters like group interactions, profile information, and other relevant factors.
- Using analytical methods to score or rank participants based on their likelihood of interest in
  the Jewish club.

## Results

The results of this project include:

- A set of potential members identified for the Jewish club based on our analysis.
- Insights into the demographics and interests of participants in HSE-related VK groups.
